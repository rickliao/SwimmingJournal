title: Day of 1 March

After the usual bobbing and practicing various vertical kick drills, we put on life jackets to train for survival. The life jacket wraped around my shoulders and kept my head afloat as expected. We learned many survival techniques. One was to put our "thin skins" (head, elbows, knees) away from water. Another was to hug together in a small group to conserve heat. In the end we played a really fun ball game in the ball with our life jackets.
