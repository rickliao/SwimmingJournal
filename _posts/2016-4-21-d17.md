title: Day of 21 April
---
This week is lifeguard appreciation week. There were multiple tools to give us a taste of what lifeguards needs to do. I tried lifting the 10 lb. block but can barely swim on my back. It certainly takes some skill to save drowning people. We also looked at AED and multiple dolls to practice CPRs. I learned a lot this week.
