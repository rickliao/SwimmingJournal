We learned butterfly today. Butterfly is basically dolphin style with two arms padding like freestyle at the same time. It is extremely tiring and supposed to go very fast. However, my butterfly is slower than my breast stroke. I need more practice and conditioning in order to do it correctly. Right now I can barely do 12.5 yards of butterfly before tiring out.
