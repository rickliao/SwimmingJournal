title: Day of 13 April

We are learning surface dives this week. There are three forms of surface dives: feet first, head first, and something else that I forgot. I found head first to be easier because I can see under water better. We were given toys where we had to retreive it after it sank under water. I also did the excercise in the deep end. It was not as hard as imagined but I guess the pressure builds up quickly the deeper I go. It was a fun excercise.
