title: Week of 1 November
---
Project 4 came out this week. Truthfully, there is not that much to add to the website from the previous phase. The only thing that is a major upgrade for our team is to integrate a database in the website. We already had dynamic pages from phase 1. I can see why only static pages were required in phase 1, however, after looking at the flask documentation on Jinja, the only thing reasonable to do is a dynamic page that loads data from Python, which is what we did. Another hard part, I think, will be the extra thousand word we have to write on the database. There are certainly things to say about our database such as the tables and keys, but many of it will be repetitive to the models section. Overall, there is just not that much to describe on such a simple database system. 

Another large topic this week is regular expressions. This is actually my first time learning it. I have saw them a lot of times before, but never had the courage or determination to learn them because of their cryptic appearance. I am glad that I had finally learned the basics of it. After the explanations in class, they actually does not seem that complicated anymore. However, I am sure I still have a lot to learn about them. 

Tip of the week: [regex 101](https://regex101.com/#python) is a really neat tool I found that allows me to test regular expression matching in real time. It also shows all the groupings of the match.
