title: Week of 22 November
---
This week is like the last week of class, for the last project is due, and all there are left is presentations from other groups. I felt a sense of relief that I made through this class. I really learned a lot through speakers, lectures, and projects, and I can finally say that I can write in Python. 

I think phase 3 of the website has a lot more writing and thinking involved than programming. We had to think about how to use another group’s data effectively and interestingly, and find out what’s good and bad about their site. It is somewhat easier to critique our own site, because I know very well the little problems here and there that happens. The only programming intensive part is the search bar. Since there are not much restrictions except to make it look like Google, we have the freedom to make it whatever we like. Of course, our solution did not behave as good as Google, I am still pretty happy at how the whole functionality turns out, especially at how we contextualize the terms. 

Looking at how to refactor in class is refreshing as well. I have never looked at a complete refactor of a whole project before. It is interesting to see how much steps one has to go through to get to the final form. 

Tip of the week: Look at other group’s site. It is amazing to see what other people have come up with and have those “why can’t I think of that?” moment.
