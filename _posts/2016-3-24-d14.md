title: Day of 24 March
---
This is my first day to swim laps in the deep pool. I immediately found a problem in switching breath in freestyle. My head/body were not rotating enough. I was simply raising my head up for air like breast stroke. This made it hard to breathe and move forward. In addition, I still had a hard time swimming long distance without having to hang on the wall to rest.
