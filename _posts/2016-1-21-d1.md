title: Day of 21 January
---
Today is the first swimming day. We started off at the smaller pool where all of us can touch the ground while in the water. First, we walked around in circular swimming pattern with either forward or backward direction. While walking, we have to move our hands to facilitate the walk. Next, we tried to swim in the same pattern, for the instructor to see how good we can actually swim. Finally, we did rhythmic breathing, also called bobs. We bob our head up and down the water, while trying to breath in normally when our head is up and breath out when our head is down.
