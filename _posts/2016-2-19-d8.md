title: Day of 19 February

After jumping into deep water for a few times, it is not as scary any more. It is true that the first time is always the first. Now it actually feels fun when jumping in. I still do not quite get breaststoke. I know what it looks like and what I am supposed to do. However, doing everything at the same time simply confuses me. I think I just need to practice more.
