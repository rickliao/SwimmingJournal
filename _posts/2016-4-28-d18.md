title: Day of 28 April
---
Toy Thursday is awesome. It is amazing to see how much things human invent to make their lives harder. Jokes aside, these training tools really gave me a workout. The two people pull was especially fun. I wished my feet could fit inside the mono-fin because it seemed to be a good practice for dolphin kicks. The under water jogging shoes looks interesting, but is actually a pain to use. It is hard to hold my balance when I use my feet to float.
