title: Day of 3 March

Today is fun day. Don brought in multiple stand up paddle boards for us to play with. As long as I don't move my legs much, I am surprisingly in pretty good balance on the board. It was fun for a few minutes. Unfortunately, the pool is too small to fully enjoy the board. I am sure paddling on a river will be a lot more exciting. It was still a good experience though.
