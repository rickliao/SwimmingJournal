title: Day of 26 January

We are still at the smaller pool today. Because it is colder today, we did stretching beforehand. The stretchings consist of warming up the whole body. The one I remembered the most is the plank, where I have to put elbows and feet on the ground and support myself up so that my whole body is as flat as a wooden plank. 

Again, we did circular swimming patterns for starters. Then, we tried to do vertical, forward, and backward floatations. While, doing floatations, we are supposed to find our center of buoyancy, which is somewhere around the lungs. There are three forward floatations: superhero, jellyfish, and the tuck. There are four backward floatations: lean back like falling to sleep, kneel and lean back, put arms to Y shape and lean back, and all of the above and do bicycle kicks.
