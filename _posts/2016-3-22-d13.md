title: Day of 22 March

First day back from spring break. I came back recharged. After treading water against the wall for a few minutes, I felt I had become a lot more stable floating in water. I decided to try the deep water test and to my excitement I passed it. Swimming 25 yards seemed to be quite a long distance, but I'm sure I will be accustomed to it after a while.
