title: Day of 2 February

Today, we learned back floating while kicking on the wall. It looked hard as I am not confident on floating on my back yet. However, somehow I managed to float almost the entire length. Then, we practiced what we are going to do when we go to the deep pool. I am both excited and nervous for when we go to the deep pool.
