title: Week of 25 October
---
This week is an especially short week for me, because I had to miss two classes (Wednesday and Friday) for interviews. In the class I got to attend, we wrote project and cross product. Project was almost the same as select, except it is filtering the columns instead of the rows. Therefore, I thought it was easy. Cross product was even simpler. All we need to do is to merge two dictionaries. The only hard part was to know the syntax in Python to build dictionaries elegantly, which I donâ€™t think is a requirement and can easily be replaced with small amounts of code. 

The first phase of the final project was also due this week. I say it was kind of a struggle for our group because we only made the basic webpages in the previous week. Frontend design was harder than I expected. I have seen many beautiful and simple to navigate websites before. However, creating one that mimics that was very time consuming. A lot of it has to do with our bad html hierarchies and extensions.  For whatever reason, our server is also extremely slow at times, which leads me to worry that the graders will dismiss it as not working. Finally, I would appreciate if the Google Doc is put on sooner. There is no reason for it to be open few hours before the project is due.

Tip of the week: Since I missed the xml lecture, I used this website on xml to catch up [xml  tutorial]( http://www.liquid-technologies.com/Tutorials/XmlSchemas/XsdTutorial_01.aspx).
