title: Week of 11 October
---
Decorators in Python sure was an elegant way to separate different assertions from functions. I was even more surprised that it can be used to create a cache. This made me like Python even more. It really has its own unique way to separate complexities in functions. Functions should do only what they are built to do, not the handful of other checks and optimizations that is usually added to them. 

This is week is also test week. While studying for the test, I found out that there are not actually that much topics to study. Even though the list of materials on Piazza is long, many of them are basic operators and functions that I had many experiences with both in class and in the projects. Also, there were a lot of practices in class, and Downing pretty much told us that the test is going to have some kind of iterator in it. The test was everything I expected. It was neither easy nor hard. The length was about right for ninety minutes, and the content was fair (as to why it was fair I cannot say too much because I cannot comment on the test).

Tip of the week: It looks like project 3 is going to involve a lot of Javascript. It is a good idea to actually start reading the “Javascript: The Good Parts” book. Since we have being neglecting Javascript topics in class, I am also slowly neglecting the readings on the book. Now is the time to pick it up once again.
