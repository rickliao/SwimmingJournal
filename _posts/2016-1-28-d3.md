title: Day of 28 January
---
As usual, we started with warmups and walking in circular swimming pattern. Then, we did the different floatations quickly. Today's lesson is quite interesting. We learned the dol;phin kick. First, we practiced it standing up. Then, we tried to use it after a wall jump. It looked hard, but my partner and I somewhat got it after a few tries. I'm sure we still have a while to go to get it good though.
